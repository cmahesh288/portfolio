                            <li>Analyzed the different factors responsible for a road accident and how the severity of a
                                road accident depends on these factors, visualized the data using matplotlib and seaborn
                                libraries.
                            </li>
                            <li>Used various classification techniques like KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, Logistic
                                regression, Random Forest and a boosting algorithm called XG Boost for predicting the
                                severity of an accident with an accuracy of 92%.
